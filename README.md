# Monitoring Soil Degradation with Remote Sensing 🛰️

## Overview 🌍
A comprehensive analysis of soil degradation in Karnataka, India (2015-2019) using remote sensing techniques and Google Earth Engine. The project implements three different change detection methods to assess and visualize land degradation patterns, achieving up to 76.3% accuracy.

## Methods 📊
1. **Index Differencing**
   - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
   - BI (Bare Soil Index)

2. **Change Vector Analysis**
   - Using NIR, SWIR, and Red bands
   - Analysis of magnitude (rho) and direction (alpha) of change

3. **RUSLE with Ancillary Data** 🗺️
   - Rainfall erosivity factor (R)
   - Soil erodibility factor (K)
   - Slope length and steepness factor (LS)
   - Cover management factor (C)
   - Conservation practice factor (P)

## Results 📈
- Index Differencing: 60.3% accuracy with BI
- Change Vector Analysis: 50.05% accuracy
- RUSLE with Ancillary Data: 76.3% accuracy
